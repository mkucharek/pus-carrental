1. Import the project to IDEA
  * make sure to choose "Maven" as the project type
2. Run it on Tomcat
  * make sure you added your exploded war file in the `Deployment` tab
3. Use `Advanced REST Client` (or any other, like `Postman`) to play around
  * Try getting all the cars and then just a single one
  * Try getting the car(s) as both `application/json` and `application/xml`
  * Try adding a car by PUTting either json or xml representation
